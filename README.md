# 32blit-case

Custom case for 32blit beta hardware.

This is now updated to fit the beta backer hardware revision.

## Notes
 
The button versions with "hole" in the name have a 1.8mm hole in the bottom.
Insert a piece of raw filament and then trim to about 1mm to create a bump.
This improves button action when the rubber membrane doesn't have big enough
bumps. You will probably only need this for the small buttons, if at all.
